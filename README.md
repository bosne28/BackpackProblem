Parallel and Distributed Processing â€“ The Knapsack Problem

This project explores the implementation of the Knapsack Problem using both sequential and parallel algorithms. The main objective is to compare performance and execution time between a traditional dynamic programming approach and a parallelized version that leverages multithreading for faster computation.

The parallel implementation divides the set of items into subranges, each processed by separate threads, allowing independent computations and improved efficiency on multi-core processors. The project demonstrates fundamental principles of parallel processing, thread synchronization, and algorithm optimization in C++.
